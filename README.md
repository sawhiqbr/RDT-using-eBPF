# RDT-using-eBPF
**reliable data transfer using extended Berkeley Packet Filter**

Hereby we propose a system for RDT using eBPF. We suggest that this approach not only enables faster reliable transfers, but also supports a paradigm we name as "dynamic kernel-level systems design". We foresee that this paradigm enables the opportunity for light-speed development and deployment of core functionalities which had been hidden under the burden of designing modules into operating system kernels where endless dependencies and recompilation processes slows down the development and lifts the threshold of ability to contribute.
